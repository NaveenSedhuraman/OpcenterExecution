            // - In folder list of summary view, XRT Table, you will see that the multi-select does not happen until you release
            //   your mouse.
            // - In folder table view, you will see that the multi-select does not happen until you release your mouse.
            // - In folder table with summary view, PWA table, when the item is not much, the multi-select happens when you press for
            //   a while, and de-select after you release your mouse.
            // - In tree view (Tractor_BOM, * as subset def), the multi-select happens when you press for a while, and de-select
            //   after you release your mouse.
            // - In list with summary view, PWA list, it works as expected. ( multi select when you press, and no de-select when you release
            //   your mouse )
            // The side effect are same for both hammer version and this version, this refactor is not trying to resolve this issue but just
            // for avoiding Hammer's performance cost.
            // In AW4.2 we can make this only for aw-list and in PL Table use another approach.
